Project Overview
This project focuses on determining the stability of an economic system by evaluating the eigenvalues of an economic interaction matrix A using MATLAB. The matrix represents how various economic sectors influence each other over time.
Eigenvalues reveal how the economy reacts to external shocks—sudden changes in supply, demand, policy, or market behavior.
If all eigenvalues lie inside the unit circle, the economy is stable, meaning shocks gradually disappear and the system returns to equilibrium.
If any eigenvalue lies outside the unit circle, disturbances grow with time, indicating an unstable economic system.
This project demonstrates how computational tools and eigenvalue-based methods can be used to analyze dynamic responses in economic models.
→ Objective
The main objectives of this project are:
To understand how eigenvalues determine economic stability
To analyze how an economy responds to shocks
To compute eigenvalues of an interaction matrix using MATLAB
To apply the spectral radius test for discrete-time stability
To simulate shock propagation over multiple economic sectors
To visualize eigenvalues and sector responses graphically
The aim is to:
Compute eigenvalues of A
Determine whether shocks die out or grow
Visualize the stability region on the complex plane
Simulate economic activity over time

Core assumptions:
The system is linear and time-invariant
Interactions occur in discrete time steps
No external forces act after the initial shock
Evolution is computed for multiple time steps.

Define the economic interaction matrix A
Compute eigenvalues using MATLAB's eig() function
Calculate the spectral radius
Apply discrete-time stability check
Plot eigenvalues on the complex plane with the unit circle
Initialize a shock and simulate economic response
Plot activity levels of all economic sectors over time
Generate a stability conclusion based on eigenvalues

The MATLAB script performs:
Printing and inspection of the interaction matrix
Calculation of eigenvalues and spectral radius
Stability decision based on magnitude of eigenvalues
Graphical plotting of eigenvalues on the complex plane
Construction of the unit circle for stability reference
Simulation of shock propagation for 20 time steps
Visualization of sector-wise responses
The code clearly separates stability analysis, visualization, and shock simulation for easier interpretation.

The computational analysis provides:
Eigenvalues of the matrix A
Real and imaginary parts location on the complex plane
Spectral radius value
Stability conclusion (stable/unstable)
Time-domain plot showing shock propagation
Typical outcomes include:
Identification of stability behavior

Observation of how quickly shocks decay or grow
Sector-by-sector sensitivity to initial disturbances
These results give insight into dynamic behavior within the economic system.

This project highlights:
Eigenvalue-based stability analysis
Discrete-time system modeling
Shock propagation in economic networks
Spectral radius interpretation
MATLAB tools for dynamic system visualization

Eigenvalue stability analysis is crucial in:
Macroeconomic forecasting
Policy impact assessment
Financial risk evaluation
Dynamic system modeling
Control of economic fluctuations
By examining eigenvalues, economists can predict whether a system will recover from shocks or diverge into instability.

→ Project Summary
This project successfully demonstrates how eigenvalues of an economic interaction matrix determine system stability.
Through MATLAB computation and simulation, the analysis shows whether shocks fade away or amplify over time.
The study emphasizes the importance of matrix-based modeling and eigenvalue analysis in understanding economic dynamics and stability.
